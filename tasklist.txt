1. Possible issues with environmental monitor assignment or alignment of data with environmental data?
2. Possible issues with data flags (51 etc.)
3. Combine little inter-function lines (e.g. 'monitors = find_monitors()') into one main() function, and move all functions to their own file.
4. Work on better activity function that calculates sleep (see "Insominia" paper).
5. Work on function that gives proper stats on period etc.
